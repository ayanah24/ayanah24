### 🧩 About Me  

I'm a **Computer Science student** and a passionate **Full-Stack Web Developer** who loves crafting elegant, scalable, and user-focused digital experiences.  
My journey started with curiosity for how websites work — now I design, build, and deploy complete solutions using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**.  

I enjoy turning abstract ideas into real, functional applications — from concept to deployment.  
Every project I build is not just code, but a reflection of my mindset: **clean architecture, reusable components, and problem-solving at the core**.  

I’m currently learning **DevOps** — exploring CI/CD, Docker, and deployment automation — to bridge the gap between development and production.  
Beyond that, I have a growing interest in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, aiming to blend data-driven intelligence with web technologies.
