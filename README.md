## 🧭 About Me  

I'm a **Computer Science and Engineering student**, with a strong interest in **backend development and scalable system design**.  
Over time, I’ve developed a solid understanding of both **frontend and backend technologies**, allowing me to build complete, production-ready web applications.  

My primary focus is on **backend development using Node.js and Express.js**, where I enjoy designing APIs, managing databases, and optimizing performance.  
Alongside that, I work with **React.js** to create clean, interactive, and component-driven frontends — ensuring the overall experience is both functional and user-friendly.  

I prefer writing code that’s **modular, readable, and easy to maintain**. Most of my learning happens through building projects — I believe real understanding comes from solving real problems.  
Currently, I’m exploring **DevOps practices**, deployment workflows, and improving how I structure and deliver full-stack solutions.
